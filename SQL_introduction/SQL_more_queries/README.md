## Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. This repository aims to provide you with more advanced SQL queries that go beyond the basics. It covers subqueries, various types of joins, aggregation functions, and window functions.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of this repository, you should have a good understanding of basic SQL concepts and have a working database system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server set up.

## Queries

### 1. Subqueries

Learn how to use subqueries to retrieve data from one query and use it in another, allowing for more complex filtering and analysis.

### 2. Joins and Unions

Explore different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to combine data from multiple tables. Also, learn about using UNION and UNION ALL to merge data from multiple SELECT statements.

### 3. Aggregation

Master the art of aggregating data using functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, and GROUP BY to get meaningful insights from your datasets.

### 4. Window Functions

Dive into window functions to perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. Functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and LEAD can help you analyze data more comprehensively.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your preferred SQL client and connect it to your database.
3. Navigate to the `queries` directory to find examples of each query type.
4. Copy and paste the queries into your SQL client to see how they work.
5. Modify the queries to fit your database schema and data.
